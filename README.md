 # React + TypeScript + Vite

 Dynamic Form Generator

This project is a dynamic form generator built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The application takes a JSON schema as input and dynamically generates a styled, functional form in real-time. The interface includes a split-screen design with a JSON editor on one side and a real-time form preview on the other.

üöÄ Features
Main Interface
Split-Screen Design
  Left Side: JSON editor with syntax highlighting, real-time validation, and error messages for invalid JSON.
  Right Side: Form preview that updates dynamically as the JSON schema is edited.
Mobile-Responsive Layout**:
 On smaller screens, the editor and form preview stack vertically for better usability.

 Form Features
- Supports all standard field types defined in the JSON schema.
- Displays proper validation messages for required fields, invalid inputs, and pattern mismatches.
- Includes loading states where appropriate.
- Allows form submission with `console.log()` and displays a success message upon completion.
- Styled consistently using **Tailwind CSS**.

Testing
- Comprehensive testing using **Playwright** (E2E testing) and **Jest** (unit testing):
  - Validates JSON schema functionality.
  - Tests real-time form generation and updates.
  - Ensures form validation and submission correctness.
  - Verifies responsiveness and error handling for edge cases.
